## 'Experimental' techniques
### From the 2007 ENCODE pilot project (doi:10.1038/nature05874)
> "In describing the major results and initial conclusions, we seek to distinguish ‘biochemical function’ from ‘biological role’. Biochemical function reflects the direct behaviour of a molecule(s), whereas biological role is used to describe the consequence(s) of this function for the organism.

> Genome-analysis techniques nearly always focus on biochemical function but not necessarily on biological role. This is because the former is more amenable to large scale data-generation methods, whereas the latter is more difficult to assay on a large scale."
