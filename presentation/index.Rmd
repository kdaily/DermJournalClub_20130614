## ENCODE

<img src="./assets/img/encode-header.jpg" alt="ENCODE" height=350>

---

## ENCODE Pilot Project (2003-2007)
### The ENcyclopedia Of DNA Elements

* Following release of human genome sequence, April 2003
* Identify and characterize sequence-based functional elements
  * Experimentally and computationally
* 35 research groups, 200 data sets
* Targeted analysis of 30Mb (1% of genome)

---

## Highlights
* More transcription than previously identified
* Symmetric distribution of regulatory sequences around TSS's
* Characteristic histone modification patterns
* 5% of genome is under (mammalian) evolutionary constraint
* Many "functional", non-constrained sites (a pool of neutral elements)

## 'Experimental' techniques
### From the 2007 ENCODE pilot project (doi:10.1038/nature05874)
> "In describing the major results and initial conclusions, we seek to distinguish ‘biochemical function’ from ‘biological role’. Biochemical function reflects the direct behaviour of a molecule(s), whereas biological role is used to describe the consequence(s) of this function for the organism.

> Genome-analysis techniques nearly always focus on biochemical function but not necessarily on biological role. This is because the former is more amenable to large scale data-generation methods, whereas the latter is more difficult to assay on a large scale."

## Not all bad
* Useful, extensive resource/dataset
* All data AND CODE are available
